## Synopsis

A web application that provides a graphical, map interface for consumers to view Wage and Hour Division and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for various industries. This project was created for submission to [DOL Fair Labor Data Challenge](http://fairlabor.challenge.gov/).

## Motivation

<blockquote>
  Your challenge is to create an application that integrates publicly-available enforcement data from the Wage and Hour Division and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for various industries with other publicly available consumer friendly data sets and consumer ratings web sites like Yelp and mapping tools like Google Maps. The application will help consumers locate such establishments and view their federal enforcement and violations history as well as read consumer reviews to help them decide where to spend their hard-earned wages.  Not only can this compliance information be useful to consumers, it can likewise factor into employeesâ€™ decisions while job hunting.
